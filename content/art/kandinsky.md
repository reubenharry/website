"Being, somehow, Cervantes, and arriving thereby at the Quixote - that looked to Menard less challenging (and therefore less interesting) than continuing to be Pierre Menard and coming to the Quixote *through the experiences of Pierre Menard*." - Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote (Borges)

I found this set of objects, arranged exactly like Kandinsky's Delicate Tension No. 85, on the floor of my bedroom after I hadn't cleaned for a few weeks.

<!-- Look, I know what you're probably thinking by this point. Does this guy have no creative bone in his body??  -->

<!-- He has some time off, and first he paints a [photorealistic replica of Las Meninas](/art/velazquez), then does [*the same thing*](/art/michelangelo) with the roof of the bloody Sistine chapel, and now [Kandinsky](https://www.museothyssen.org/en/collection/artists/kandinsky-wassily/delicate-tension-no-85)?! -->

<!-- (What you see in the right-hand image was actually arranged exactly like this on the floor by coincidence when I woke up one morning.) -->

<!-- Sometimes having a good eye is all it takes, and I'm pretty proud that I recognized the exact shape and arrangement of Delicate Tension, No.85 by Wassily Kandinsky in the collection of detritus on my bedroom floor. -->
