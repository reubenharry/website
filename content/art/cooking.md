In the spirit of adding a constraint to get past an overwhelming abundance of choices, I decided that the "learn to cook so you can navigate adult life" journey would be curry only. Obviously this raises a somewhat tedious question of what a curry is, but I'm going by the rule of: anything generally called a curry.

So far:

### Week 1: Thai Green Curry

Rated 5 stars, for Abundance of Vegetables, pleasantly thick coconut base, flavorful bamboo shoots, and absence of feeling of revulsion on repeated consumption.

### Week 2: Japanese Curry

Tasted great, easy to cook, hearty.

### Week 3: Bengali Fish Curry

Frying the fish separately took a long time. Feeling of revulsion on repeat consumption: only mild.

### Week 4: Cambodian Saraman

Made the curry paste from First Principles. Failure to obtain mortar and pestle was blessing in disguise. Blender is optimal. Too much lemongrass, but turned out edible.

### Week 5: Caribbean Jerk Chicken and Sweet Potato Curry

Beans take a long time to cook. Buy jerk seasoning from a Caribbean place, not Whole Foods.

### Week 6: Sri Lankan Jackfruit, Potato, Chicken and Green Been Curries

This was good. Big fan of jackfruit.

### Week 7: Ethiopian Doro Wat

<!-- ### African Curry

### Sri Lankan jackfruit/mango Curry

### Jerk Curry

### Mauritian Curry

### Thai Masaman Curry

### Thai Red Curry

### Chicken Tikka Masala -->
