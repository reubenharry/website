"The Cervantes text and the Menard text are verbally identical, but the second is almost infinitely richer" - Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote (Borges)

<!-- "Composing the *Quixote* in the early seventeenth century was a reasonable, necessary, perhaps even inevitable undertaking; in the early twentieth, it is virtually impossible." - Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote (Borges) -->

(To clarify, the right-hand image is my one, and the left-hand is the original.)

<!-- Look, I know what you're thinking: why would anyone paint a brush-stroke-for-brush-stroke replica of Las Meninas? It's needless. -->

<!-- And yes, I take your point - the time I put into this visually perfect replica of Velázquez's masterpiece was probably not well spent, but let me explain. -->

<!-- let me try to justify it -->
<!-- can see the stultifying pointlessness of this kind of hyper-realism. But let's not  -->


<!-- What I'm trying to do here is basically the same as what [Pierre Menard](http://hispanlit.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2011/06/Borges-Pierre-Menard.pdf) was trying to do when he rewrote a chapter of Don Quixote word for word. In Borges' words, Menard had "no intention of copying" Cervantes, and similarly, when I recreated Velazquez' ingenious inversion of artist and subject, painstakingly replicating every line of the original (especially the dog), I wasn't copying. -->

<!-- I guess what I'm saying is that, even though it might seem like an uncreative act to just produce a photo-realistic copy of a painting like I've done above, the act of recontextualizing it in the 20th century is really new and important.  -->

<!-- when I painted La Princessa -->
<!-- virtually indistinguishable from her representation in Velázquez' original masterpiece, I wasn't trying to copy. I was trying to reinvent. -->
