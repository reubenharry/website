On the grounds that you can eat curry for every meal for a week and get (unreasonably) sick of it, we decided to eat curry for every meal every week.

Some thoughts on the results:

### Week 1: Thai Green Curry

Rated 5 stars, for Abundance of Vegetables, pleasantly thick coconut base, flavorful bamboo shoots, and absence of feeling of revulsion on repeated consumption.

### Week 2: Japanese Curry

Tasted great, easy to cook, hearty.

### Week 3: Bengali Fish Curry

Frying the fish separately took a long time. Feeling of revulsion on repeat consumption: only mild.

### Week 4: Cambodian Saraman

Made the curry paste from First Principles. Failure to obtain mortar and pestle was blessing in disguise. Blender is optimal. Too much lemongrass, but turned out edible.

### Week 5: Caribbean Jerk Chicken and Sweet Potato Curry

Beans take a long time to cook. Buy jerk seasoning from a Caribbean place, not Whole Foods.

### Week 6: Sri Lankan Jackfruit, Potato, Chicken and Green Been Curries

This was good. Big fan of jackfruit.

### Week 7: Ethiopian Doro Wat

Probably our best effort. Not a curry, but I wanted to try making it.

### Week 8: Thai Panang Curry

Too much sauce.

### Week 9: Chana Masala and Goan Fish Curry

### Week 10: Chicken Korma and Paneer Korma

### Week 11: Chicken Tikka Masala

Turned out amazing.
