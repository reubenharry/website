So I read this [really great short story]() by Borges recently, and it got me thinking. It's about a writer called Pierre Menard who dedicates his life to rewriting Miguel de Cervantes'
	check
	17th century novel Don Quixote.


	Menard isn't your average guy. His goal is not some knock off version of Cervantes. He wants to produce an exact replica of the original.  Word for word.

	His method, in Borges' words, is "relatively simple: Learn Spanish, return to Catholicism, fight against the Moor or Turk, forget the history of Europe from 1602 to 1918 - *be* Miguel de Cervantes."

	Borges is quick to point out that Menard has "no intention of copying" Cervantes, and

	remarks that
	"The Cervantes text and the Menard text are verbally identical, but the second is almost infinitely richer".


Obviously this got me thinking.
	I'm no writer, but if I say so myself, I'm a pretty good painter, so it was pretty obvious what I had to do: paint a photorealistic replica of a 17th century Spanish painting
		which at the same time

As you can see, there isn't a brush stroke that's different to the original painting. It's a near photorealistic replica. This really helped me understand what Borges meant. Even though the visual appearance of the two paintings is totally indistinguishable,
	really the technical feat
	so much as

	recontextualized. Looking at my version on the right, you see a completely different painting to the one on the left. Not physically - obviously they are identical in that sense. But the painting on the right you see knowing that it was produced by someone who understood the visual traditions of, say, Van Gogh, Picasso,
		Totally different.

High on my success from painting 1

But then I reread Borges' short story again, and realized I'd missed the point: "Being, somehow, Cervantes, and arriving thereby at the Quixote - that looked to Menard less challenging (and therefore less interesting) than continuing to be Pierre Menard and coming to the Quixote *through the experiences of Pierre Menard*".

This led me to my third, and I think, greatest piece, shown next to the original below:

I'll be honest, I [Tracey Emined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracey_Emin#Found_objects) this one: this set of objects was actually arranged exactly like this on the floor when I woke up one morning. Sometimes having a good eye is all it takes, and I'm pretty proud that I recognized the exact shape and arrangement of Delicate Tension, No.85 by Wassily Kandinsky while looking at the detritus in my bedroom without my glasses on.
