I occasionally write things for magazines/journals:

- [Echo, Narcissus, and the ghost in the machine](https://www.noemamag.com/gpts-very-inhuman-mind/)
- [Creative fiction](https://carmenerror.com/?page_id=215)
- [Cathedrals of convention: essentialism in language (and elsewhere)](https://aeon.co/essays/are-the-exact-words-of-a-language-arbitrary-or-necessary)

I also write [notes](/maths) when I'm trying to learn maths, as well as [documentation](https://haskell-docs.netlify.app/) for functional programming languages.
