Hi! I'm a linguistics PhD student at Stanford. I think about meaning using tools from functional programming, Bayesian probability and machine learning:

### [Computational Language Games](www.google.com)

[Pragmatically Informative Image Captioning with Character-Level Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05417) (Reuben Cohn-Gordon, Noah Goodman and Christopher Potts)

### Social Meaning

[Modeling "Non-literal" Social Meaning with Bayesian Pragmatics](www.google.com) (Reuben Cohn-Gordon and Ciyang Qing)

[Non-descriptive/use-conditional meaning in Rational Speech-Act models](www.google.com) (Ciyang Qing and Reuben Cohn-Gordon)

### Past Work

Amharic Dares, Monads for NL Semantics, Latin Resultatives, Ability Modals
