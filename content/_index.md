I'm currently a research scientist at UC Berkeley, working on [high dimensional sampling problems](https://blackjax-devs.github.io/sampling-book/algorithms/mclmc.html) that arise in physics and ML, but more broadly am interested in the intersection of statistical physics and Bayesian inference.

I occasionally write things for magazines/journals:

- [Echo, Narcissus, and the ghost in the machine](https://www.noemamag.com/gpts-very-inhuman-mind/)
- [Creative fiction](https://carmenerror.com/?page_id=215)
- [Cathedrals of convention: essentialism in language (and elsewhere)](https://aeon.co/essays/are-the-exact-words-of-a-language-arbitrary-or-necessary)

I also write technical notes sometimes:

- [Maths and Physics](https://maths-physics-notes.netlify.app/)
- [Functional Programming (in Haskell)](https://haskell-docs.netlify.app/) and [probabilistic programming](https://monad-bayes.netlify.app/)
