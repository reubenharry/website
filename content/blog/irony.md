**This is a description of [this project](/docs/irony.pdf)**

So the idea here was to characterize the core dynamic of sarcasm. With (1) in mind (or a sarcastic utterance of your choosing)

> (1) Wow, I really loved that play.

For instance, imagine

(2) Yeah mum, I'm just in the park doing heroin

(3) Oh yeah, I'm gonna buy a Tesla then

The idea: if you say (1), it conveys that it was already in the *common ground* that you did not love the play. Why?

	The dynamic is analogous to countersignaling, as discussed in the game theoretic economic literature:

		if your interlocutor already knew that you hated the play, pretending (i.e. speaking as if you were in the counterfactual world in which) you loved carries relatively low risk of your interlocutor failing to detect that you are pretending.

		So a listener aware of this trade-off can infer that the speaker must have believe the

		And conversely, a speaker can leverage this inference to communicate about the common ground.

If I say P, signals that I need to say it


sarcasm is a way of communicating about the (prior) common ground

What we did in this paper was to take this intuitive story and formalize it. This turned out to be very fruitful. We were forced to be precise about what it means to pretend linguistically, and ended up with nice predictions about the space of contexts in which sarcasm is communicatively effective.

Here's a heatmap from the paper:


We went a certain way towards fleshing this story out in the paper (dealing with ironic questions, understatement and some other phenomena), but there's a very exciting open space of questions about more sophisticated pretenses, ironic and otherwise.
