Various pieces you can do:

	latent variables as representations: framing the debate in bayesian terms
 -->

<!-- Each piece has a statement and then an explanation:

Objects aren't in the world, they're in the mind
	Thought is full of hollow objects
	Philosophical and literary skepticism about reification is the thing

Next piece: this is a fun piece on ghosts in the machine: start with tourist asking you about...

objects which aren't there.
The example of Homer

THIS GOES SOMEWHERE: i think outside this piece

I find this compelling because science and mathematics are full of things which only exist as a way of speaking, like talking about
various kinds of vibrations as particles,  
physics example: particles

Even in the study of natural language: "the occasional sailor" is no particular sailor, but can do anything a sailor can: "the occassional sailor walks past". Similarly, "the average family" has more than 1 child and
Nobody: fit the cyclops idea in here


Idea 1: AI is really about understanding the mind, because once you understand a thing, getting a computer to do it is the (relatively) easy part.

Idea 2: things out in the world are actually representations: quote jackendoff here



	writing about copying:

		task of copying meaning
		fails without understanding
		by understanding, we mean: accessing representations
		in fact, an example where this plays out is scribes
		computational example: translating between markup languages
		comparison: translating between computer languages and translating between natural languages: difference of complexity different type fundamentally?

	theme/framing:

		the invention of nature (keep this in mind, but reserve option of saving it for the next chapter)


	content:

		representations are both abstract and concrete things: this is a big idea
		the idea from computer science and philosophy of language that certain objects are ways of talking and don't correspond one to one to things in the model, like amb, or "nobody" or "an occasional sailor"
		concrete example:
