good: guidepost is the Fermi vs fermi rule


people do this thing of mixing up the manifest and scientific images:
    - belief in fate (astrology, etc)

or:

    Greek myths, in which a character goes about avoiding their destiny in a way that all but ensures it, exemplify a more general propensity of fables and religions to build human concerns into nature.

    You have Aegeus, for example, who is fated to be killed by his grandson. Despite taking every precaution (lock up your daughter!, throw away the keys!, flee the country!), when he goes to a discus throwing tournament on a distant island, who should be there but his grandson! And what should he be doing but innocently hurling a discus Aegeus-wards while this ill-fated grandfather looks the other way. It couldn't have been by chance, it was an act of fate.

    Nature, in truth, does not care about human outcomes, despite the central premise of stories like these that it does.
    Or rather, it is totally agnostic to them. If nature had a ledger
            it might mark positions and momenta of particles, but not whether
                John got admitted to college on a Wednesday or the number of cats in Central Park at 3pm on a Tuesday.
        not just like premise that certain events are fated, but the idea that events, like
            or
            are things that nature has access to.

    Nature might ensure an invariant like the total energy of a closed system but not an invariant like the amount of enthusiasm for racquetball in Colombia.

    There is a law of nature that two fermions cannot occupy the same state simultaneously. On the other hand, there is no law that two people called Fermi cannot be in the same room at one time.

    What is at issue is a distinction between the *scientific image* of the world, and the *manifest image*. These are terms coined by philosopher Wilfred Sellars, the former referring to the world in the physical sense, of atoms bumping (or fields oscillating) around in the void, and the latter, the *manifest image*, referring to the world as humans view it, filled with all sorts of entities, from events like wars, birthdays and unexpected embarrassing encounters, to concepts like moral responsibility, regret and luck.

    Nature concerns itself with only the scientific image not the manifest one, which is precisely the difference between a law about fermions, and a law about Fermi.

    It is also what is wrong with the Greek concept of fate; it's not just the idea of certain events being inevitable that is untrue, but that natural laws can even be formulated about events like Aegeus being killed by his grandson, something which exists in the manifest image.

    This is not to say that the manifest image and the scientific image can't be bridged - after all, isn't the point of science to take the world as we experience it and put it in mathematical terms - but that there are right and wrong ways to do it.

    The way in which Greek myths about fate get it wrong is twofold. First the obvious fact that events are not fated.
        But second, the more subtle
            that it would even be possible for nature to mark out an event, like Aegeus being killed by his grandson, as if that was a well-defined event in the physical world like
                the decay of an atom
                or the

        to adopt and perhaps slightly repurpose a phrase coined by the philosopher and mathematician
    Whitehead, this could be called the fallacy of misplaced concreteness.

    same as looking for
        don't look for it among the neurons
            quote dennett todo

    The fallacy of misplaced concreteness lives in an interesting limbo between a kind of literary pretense and a genuine mistaken belief.

    One the one hand are superstitions
        Even by calling something a superstition, it is understood that it isn't real - that nature does not really know or care about whether you walk under a ladder or
            ...

        On the other hand, there are religions.
            import

    Astrology is an excellent example in the middle of this divide. On the one hand, people talk about being a Taurus or an Aries, not to seriously underscore a belief in a correlation between the position of the planets at the time of birth and facets of their personality, but as a kind of game that acts as a shibboleth for queer culture. On the other hand, some people put genuine stock in the connection between

    It is also the difference between Greek myths taken as
        and Greek myths ala Ovid, who tells them with an ironic slant, as a game of
            finding

        import more examples

    Narcissus is a culprit of this fallacy, par
        excellance.

    The much more interesting thing about them is the idea that human events are in the purview of nature at all, as if nature is able to even ascertain whether a person has been killed by their grandson, let alone ensure it.

    This kind of direct connection between nature and the manifest image is a hallmark not just of myths, but of political statements of manifest destiny (nature marking the founding of Rome, American imperialism, etc...), superstitions (nature marking the event of walking under a ladder), astrological predictions, and of course, religions.

    A person - not their body but their hard to define gestalt, their personality, their them-ness - is eternal, according to most Christian traditions. Again, the claim that it is eternal is less interesting than the idea that it can be isolated at all, as a thing in the world which nature marks out.

    In that vein, the notion of moral action, again a concept which is notoriously hard to pin down, is marked out by nature
        so that a person

    and once
        it becomes plausible to think that nature must
            first by designing men and women with a purpose in mind, then by

    Jewish traditions
        take this realism about the manifest image to the extreme, so that the entire text of the Old Testament is said to have been passed down to Moses on Mount Sinai,
            existing as a source code for the universe.
        gematria

    both personal and collective destinies

    But again, the specific of the beliefs are less at issue than the central realism: humans, events in their lives, their actions, their intents, their pain, their purpose are all, according to these religious traditions, marked out by nature.

    To get a handle on what this realism amounts to, you have to imagine nature as you would imagine a computer game, for example the game shown in figure TODO.

        GOOD:
            instead of this game, use a webbrowser screenshot:
                things like tabs and the position of the mouse are real. MUCH clearer
    In this game, you (that being the person in the middle of the screen) run and jump around the 2 dimensional level, avoiding dangers and making your way to the exit before a timer runs out.

    In the world of the game, the scientific image would consist of the position and momentum of the pictured protagonist, the locations of various enemies, the time remaining to complete the level. It includes the laws of physics in the game

    As a programmer, with access to the source code of the game, you have access to all these things. You could write a program that would tell you
        it might go something like this:

    while True:
        enemies = [object for object in game.objects if object.enemy]
        if len(enemies) > 5:
            return True

    You could build

    to believe something is real in the game is to believe it to be something which you could

    Imagine yourself as a programmer, examining the source code of a game. Anything in the scientific image is fair game for you to inspect or determine via the code.

    For example

    propositions like:  
        How many times has the player been killed by a fall?

    All these things as available for you as a programmer, when

        a good heuristic for:
            does the game
            is:
                could you write a program which identified that thing?

            For example, the property of being in

        Here are some things
            - whether the runner is alive or dead
            - the speed and direction of the runner
            - the speed at which a collision with a wall will prove fatal


    In the real world, the scope of the scientific image is an open question, since we don't have the luxury - afforded to us in the game - of making the rules.
        But centuries of study have made clear an increasingly pleasant and surprising
            characterization of what is in the scientific image.


    The manifest image concerns
        what

        In the world of the game, there is a concept of a mistake,
            danger
            or: a static level vs a race level





























        all superstitions have exactly this quality.

    This




    First and foremost, it is a leading premise of religions.
        in the Bible,
            not only are certain events fated, just like in Greek myths,
                but the text of the Old Testament is physically handed to Moses by God. This text, the series of words that
                    is, in this belief system, part of nature. It's the source code of nature, in fact.
        species
        the act of eating an apple from a tree

    Even discarding the literal elements of
        the idea that
            souls

    There is the superstition that articulating a desire will lead to it not coming true, some variation of which features in many cultures. Also superstitions regarding black cats, or
        Nature doesn't keep track of objects like cats, much less things you say, at least not in any direct way.

        What is more telling than fiction are cases where this fantasy of the manifest image carved into the joints of nature is taken in earnest,
        and where people live their lives with total conviction in these beliefs.

<!-- This is sometimes meant with grave seriousness (like messianic prophecies which predict that specific events involving salvation or judgment will come to pass), and sometimes with an ironic stance (the modern discourse around astrology) -->

    Biblical prophecies,
    all share the feature that they envision a version of nature which *does* care about the manifest image in this very direct way.

        For example,
            nature knows the species
            nature is in charge of the fate of the Jewish people

            nature would have to mark the event of a person walking under a ladder


        coin:
            essentialist thinking


  The Greek myth version of fate is a wrong way, but why exactly?
                Moving on from forensic analysis of Greek mythology
                not just wrong in the idea that certain events are destined
                even if they weren't destined

            or:
                but now, the forks differentiate two outcomes. In one branch, the protagonist becomes a famous movie star, in the other, a
                The jig is already up, because
                    why would a random quantum event
                        correspond cleanly to a schism between two paths in a person's life.
                    There again is that telltale error:
                        the overliteral correspondence between

            , but there are many others, analogous to it.

                describe Greek myth problem

                Not many people believes in fate in the Greek sense, or life their lives by it, but the same kind of
                    is


    evo
        again, this explanation makes the fatal assumption that nature cares about the manifest image. It pictures a world like
            Pokemon,
                where species are natural kinds
            The truth is that while the idea of species is important, it isn't built into nature. Nature, for example, does not
                you couldn't

    Of course, the manifest image is not unrelated to the scientific one - Fermi, after all, is made of matter - but the relationship is exquisitely subtle.

    the classical picture
        is that the bridge might be complex, but not subtle.
            The
                would be broken down into simpler compoments (the notion of an event in general, the
                    )
                until everything is explained.
        The root of the optimism that this kind of modular approach is possible is the success of breaking
            code describing
                gets broken down into ever simpler

        Fodor's language of thought

    To give an example
        people talk easily and commonly of events, like England winning the 1966 Football World Cup, the time Joey pretended to own a Porsche on Friends, the hypothetical event of England winning again, the
        what example?

        An event like England winning the 2026 Football World Cup
        does not correspond to any one particular state of the world (nor is it obvious that it corresponds even to a set of states). It just isn't a thing that nature identifies as an object.
                Accordingly, it doesn't appear as a thing which natural laws can talk about.
            If you had a belief that England's victory in 2026 was a natural certainty, you
                First, there is no evidence.
                But more importantly, there simply can't be natural laws like this.



    To be sure, these are related, but the nuances of how are subtle.

    Science, as a whole, could be thought of as a process of trying to create bridges to allow concepts in the manifest image to be moved into the scientific image.

        whether that be in biology, where the concept of heredity corresponds to genetic material and its replication, in chemistry, where atomic
            theories explain reactions and their rates, or physics, where calculus, linear algebra and geometry

    But many concepts which are fundamental in the manifest image have not been translated into the scientific image. The information content of a book is notoriously hard to define in a precise way: what exactly is the content that the Bible in English and Hebrew share?

    As is the predicate of moral responsibility: what are the rules which determine whether John, who stole out of hunger, should be held responsible for his actions and punished.


    of human things, the *manifest image*, in contrast to






























    A law of nature concerning fermions can be (and is) "written" in terms of the scientific image of the world. A putative law concerning Fermi could not be written in terms of the scientific image, because entities like Fermi do not live there.

        pseudocode in both cases

    If one considers what it would be like if nature *did* work this way, one can find example  
        in fiction.

    For example, in the Harry Potter books, saying a word is
        nature has to know what counts as saying a particular word versus a different noise - it is attuned to this distinction.
            it also has to be able to enact changes to
                a spell that repairs glasses





If nothing else,
    people are totally capable of believing in a version of nature which features the manifest image
    in totally wrong ways.


Bearing in mind this propensity for this kind of confused thinking, it is not hard to imagine that it might play a role in a variety of scientific debates.
        it is easy to dismiss beliefs in fate or destiny as obvious fictions, but how obvious are they really

Evolution was hard to accept not only because it was a starkly different way kind of explanation about a facet of the natural world, but because it
    implies a world in which life is not baked into nature directly.

    what was more or less an extension of Biblical thinking, in which the kinds of life on earth were prespecified, designed
        not unlike the
            cohort of species in Po
                kemon

    Rather than a world in which all the different kinds of animals were
        "written down in nature's ledger",
        in the evolutionary picture, they emerge from increasingly complex forms of physical self replication.
    Species are still a useful concept, but they aren't baked into nature directly.
        species are in the manifest image of the world
            rather than directly in nature.


Discourses about conscious life forms are seeped even more deeply in
    essentialist thinking.


    the existence of a soul as an object tracked by nature, separable from and enduring beyond the body is once again a tenet of many religious traditions
        moral judgments are built in terms of the soul


    It is outmoded now to use the term *soul* in a scientific context, but the more palatable word *mind* carries much the same meaning of an abstract object that contains all important information about an agent's behavior, entirely separate from whatever its physical form might be.
    And the premise that a *mind* in this sense is a sensible object of study pervades many academic disciplines

<!-- This thin line between intentional fictions about nature

<!-- often with an ironic stance that critics regularly miss. -->









    Which isn't to say that the manifest and scientific image are unrelated - but that their relationship is complicated and poorly understood.


 <!-- as a game of naturalizing personal identity).  -->

    One can think of this as a failure to perceive (or intentional decision to ignore) the difference between the manifest and the scientific image.








    not just beliefs which are clearly understood to be fictional, but beliefs which people seriously live their lives by

        example is deliberately facetious, but
        for example, strong personal beliefs in destiny (like a belief that you were destined to be famous) which

    Where things become particularly interesting are cases where scientific inquiry is stymied by a
        incorrect
            of the manifest image.



    Again, one can imagine what it would look like if this realist version of nature was the case.

    There would be a compendium of species hardwired into the world

        Again, this is a familiar premise in religious texts (think of Noah's ark), and in fictional worlds (think of
            Po
                kemon
            each designed perfectly to fit into its environment, and all differing in their
            )
        .

        As a philosopher, one might say that animal species are natural kinds.
            Although the natural kind status of species continues to be a point of discussion,

    Compare this to pokemon:
        in this world, the different
            species are explicitly part of the
        Pokemon
            has the same literalism about species that Greek myths have about events in the world

    Attempts to understand not just life, but cognition, are marked by an even greater propensity to confuse the manifest and scientific image,
        and this is where our story begins in earnest.


    A typical example of this confusion is seen in attempts to reify the mind or "soul" as an object that is not physical but is somehow lodged in a physical body.
    any examples of confusion?

    This is primarily because people
        inhabit the manifest image in their daily goings-about,
        so studying cognition requires facing the manifest image head on.

``The chasm between the mainfest image and the scientific image is at its most treacherous when the topic is free will. Like the questions of what color is, what it \emph{really} is, and what dollars are, \emph{really}, when you get right down to it the question of whether free will is an illusion or something we actually have invites us to use the scientific image to investigate this issue, which is posed in the traditional terms of the manifest image.''

the model people have in mind is of a "garden of forking paths", a series of choice points where the future could go one way or another. And true enough, one can view the physical world in this way.

One can also identify forking paths in the manifest image.

    to pick one example from many, the movie *Everything Everywhere All at Once* considers a series of counterfactuals, in which the main protagonist
     didn't marry the man she loves, didn't leave home, had a chance encounter that led her to becoming a movie star, worked


But the forking paths in the manifest image do not correspond to forking paths in the scientific image, and vice versa.

Conversely, the decay of a particle
    is a physical forking path, but it does not correspond to any fork that would matter in human terms.

If forking in the manifest image and the scientific image were the same kind of thing, then one would have to worry
    And indeed, this seems to worry some people very much:
        ...
        Dennett, and other *compatibilists* see this worry as precisely a confusion of the scientific image and the manifest image.
        It would be like
            worrying if the Fermi exclusion principle excluded two people called Fermi from standing next to each other.
