the key: you also need to bring an interpretation

Poems, Seferis declares, always exist, they just


Statues, Michelangelo blahs,

	Borges, whose favourite tool is to take metaphors literally, imagines an enormous library, in which every book can be found

		finding answers: people search

	In The Library of Babel, Borges takes this literally

to create a thing, all we have to do is find it:

	translation
	planning
	painting

"The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable."

		"(I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one’s palm . . . They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)"

		"From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite) that is, everything it is given to express: in all languages. Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels’ autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books, the treatise that Bede could have written (and did not) about the mythology of the Saxons, the lost works of Tacitus."

		"When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. "

		information theoretic point that if everything is meaningful, nothing is meaningful

		possible worlds semantics
		textual variants: how do you represent a book?

		basically the question of deciding whether there is an intentional author

		dennett and questions of semantics:



		point of piece:

			babel, michelangelo, seferis all voice an idea. AI as search

		Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it.
