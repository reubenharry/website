alt title: The Borgesification of Philosophy


"Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it." - Michelangelo

Borges inhabits a genre I think of as ironic realism. This is characterized by a trope where he takes a philosophical idea and makes it parochially literal in a deliberately absurd way.

	In the interest of coining long awkward words (it's a feature, not a bug), I'll call this trope *borgesification*.


			(As such, I read Borges stories as lighthearted warnings about the perils of philosophical misconceptions regarding meaning.)

Two examples from my favourite of his stories:

1: Library of Babel: Creativity as Search


	One of the key traditional ideas in AI is that creativity is just search in the appropriate search space.

	This applies both to problems that have an obvious search-like element (e.g. planning a route from 2 points that your roomba should take) but also creative tasks like writing a novel: there's a space of possible ways your novel could be, and **all you have to do** is to find the right one.

	To take this seriously, one first has to define the space of possible
		"answers"
			have some measure of how good an answer is.


	Of course, this reframing of the problem doesn't afford you any immediate gains: there's no easy way to search the space of possible novels.

				abstract space of possible texts and creativity is merely finding points in the space.

					This idea reminds me of three things:

						the Greek poet Seferis' remark that ``all poems written or unwritten exist...The special ability of the poet is to see them.''.

						Dan Dennett's notion of an abstract design space over which evolution performs a search.

						echo, on michelangelo: "Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it.""

	### **Creativity as Search** Borgesified

		In The Library of Babel, all books exist, present in an enormous library which constitutes the known world. Every possible combination of words seems to be present in some book somewhere.

		"Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels’ autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books, the treatise that Bede could have written (and did not) about the mythology of the Saxons, the lost works of Tacitus."

		In this universe, people search for truth by physically searching the library for the book that contains it.
					In this universe, the search for new ideas happens over a design space which is the space of all possible book-length strings of characters

		what's the borgesification:

			My claim was that Borges' trick was to take something literally in an absurd way; how exactly is that the case here?

			The core of it is that strings of characters are the wrong space to be searching for meaning.

				You don't come across a proposition by rifling through sequences of letters that happen to spell one sentence representing it, just as you wouldn't learn to program by memorizing muscle movements corresponding to successful programs.

				Perhaps that analogy is stretched beyond its means. What I mean is that the search for, e.g. truths, should be happening at a higher level of abstraction: you should be searching ideas, not strings of characters.

				Moreover (most over) it is absurd to thing that any book in the library "means" anything, in the sense of being anything more than a random series of characters. If you find a book describing
					FOO
						then it describes that because of your interpretation (say the English alphabet and language)

				naturalizing the observations according to your world

					"(I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one’s palm . . . They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)"



			This leads to a question posed by Douglas Hofstadter as the jukebox question of meaning TODO CHECK
				what part of the content of a book is in the physical object, and what part is in the system which interprets it?
				Erring to far one way




			WHAT's the AI parallel to searching the library assuming things have meaning?

				oh it's there all right: sphexishness


				QUOTE


					parody of efforts to find structure: these observations (books) are not evidence of structure in the latent space, even if particular books appear very structured:

					this is like?
						: finding meaning in kaballah

MAYBE DROP ALL OF THE SECOND ONE
	Philosophical Idea 2: Pierre Menard

		creativity is recontextualisation

		AI spin?? :

				(when you're unsure what to do, remember this as your destination: borges' idea of inventing an author/meaning is like a virtual object, and all objects are virtual. make the connection abundantly clear)

				Postmodern strains of thought often take interest
					in the notion that the meaning of texts (writ broad)
						are not fixed in the texts themselves, but are continually recreated by succesive authors' usage of those texts

						Thus two authors can express the same idea but have it be understood differently...??

						also: forms are necessary
					or: none of the meaning is natural to the text itself
				or more precisely: texts that are conceptually the same can differ by context NOT QUITE
			the idea that writing is really just recontextualisation of past texts:
				for example, Catullus writes a poem
					remarkably similar to:
						...
						is this good example?

				This radical idea builds on the difficulty in separating the meaning of a text from the process of interpretation.
					to what degree is blah Blah and to what degree is its blahness a result of our interpretation

					most radical: nothing in text at all



			Borgesification:

				Finally my favourite.

				story: pierre menard...

				Pierre Menard is a poet totally devoted to creating original work, but his magnum opus is a word for word copy of Don Quixote.
					Borges goes into great detail pointing about how...

					quotes:

						The Cervantes text and the Menard text are verbally identical, but the second is almost infinitely richer. `..truth, whose mother is hostiry, rival of time, depository of deeds...'': written by the ``ingenious layman'' miguel de Cervantes, is mere rhetorical praise of history, [but for menard]: History, the mother of truth! - the idea is straggering. Menard, a contemporary of William James, defines history not as a delving into reality but as the ery fount of reality.The contrast in styles...

				AH: (quix X context1) vs (quix X context2): tensor product


				point here:
			I'm also thinking of his imagined poet, Pierre Menard, who copies Don Quixote word for word, in order to produce an entirely original text.

				in this case, the philosophical point in the background is that


				but which are only fantasy by virtue of taking a philosophical idea to an overliteral extreme:


				he even admits it: fantasy quote

		Borgesification without Borges:

			Borgesification is pretty ubiquitous
				both as a technique in literature
				and a genuine fallacy in philosophy

				for the former,
					in one of many excellent Series of Unfortunate Events (surely the most postmodern children's books ever written), there is a door that can only be unlocked by entering on a keyboard the central theme of Anaa Karenina
						this, is ``is that a rural life of moral simplicity, despite its monotony, is the preferable personal narrative to a daring life of impulsive passion, which only leads to tragedy.''

					This is a borgesification, because while Anna Karenina might indeed have a central theme, the premise of this situation is that the precise wording Klaus provides is somehow
						is that the door requires to be provided a particular point in the sentence space, not the idea space

					precise wording is surely not derivable

						search space of ideas: choose idea
						requires: search space of words

			This sort of confusion between high level ideas (like
			) and low level ones is

				for the latter, I think that the view that free will has anything to do with the physical world's being determined or not, is really a fallacy of borgesification


			Ovid loves borgesification.
			EXAMPLE:














"The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable."

		"(I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one’s palm . . . They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)"

		"From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite) that is, everything it is given to express: in all languages. Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels’ autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books, the treatise that Bede could have written (and did not) about the mythology of the Saxons, the lost works of Tacitus."

		"When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. "
