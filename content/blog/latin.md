**About: [this project](docs/resultatives.pdf)**

I did a Classics degree for my undergrad, but towards the end had already started tending closer to linguistics. This project was a toeing of the line towards the latter. The idea was to reanalyze one of the many Latin grammatical phenomena given a fancy Greek name, *prolepsis*, in modern terms. Most cases of *prolepsis* are in Latin poetry, where an adjective describes an attribute that its noun hasn't yet accrued. The drosophila is "sink the sunk ships", where "sunk" anticipated the unfortunate forthcoming event. My argument was that this wasn't really nearly as weird as it looked, and actually it was better translated as (dum dum dum) "sink the ships sunk", i.e. a resultative clause like "sing yourself hoarse" or "the lake froze solid". These turn out to be pretty interesting in their own right - lexical semantics has a lot to say about their properties. For instance, you can't laugh yourself, or talk someone, but you can laugh yourself silly and talk someone into the ground. Thinking about how weird this was, and reading Ray Jackendoff's excellent *Foundations of Language* got me into linguistics. Anyway, I digress.
