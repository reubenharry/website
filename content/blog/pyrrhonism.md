This post definitely falls under philosophical miscellania, but is, I feel, a nice example of how philosophers from very different time periods converge on the same ideas.

Sextus Empiricus, medieval skeptic, wrote a big (not Aquinas big, but definitely David Foster Wallace big) treatise on Pyrrhonism (a brand of radical skepticism that I've always been fond of) which argues (more or less) that nothing is knowable. More specifically, he rejects *dogma* (roughly, scientific knowledge).

Of course, this runs into hot or at least lukewarm water soon enough, since one might wonder whether one knows P, for P="Dogma is unknowable.".

Sextus' solution is to offer two notions of dogma (the sort of thing one should have skepticism over): narrow dogma and broad dogma. One must reject narrow dogma, but the rejection of narrow dogma (i.e. P="Narrow dogma is unknowable.") is a broad dogma, and that's totally fine to keep.

Jump to Russell, and his famous paradox as to whether to set of all sets that don't contain themselves contains itself. One solution, Russell's, is to have a hierarchy of types. Type 1 sets can't contain type 1 sets, but type 2 sets can (and so on for type 3 containing 2, etc). This eliminates the paradox.

Sextus' solution to self-refutation is Russell's solution to Russell's paradox, *mutatis mutandis*. Granted, you have to mutatis a fair bit of mutandis, but all the same.
