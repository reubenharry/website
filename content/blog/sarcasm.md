I found this sign funny enough that I had to take a picture:

Why? On face value, I agree with the
    in fact I already knew that you probably shouldn't keep your money submerged in a bathtub.

What is funny is the information that comes from the fact that it was necessary to inform anyone
    The implication being that some people did not know

Indeed, communicating in general has a second order effect. If I say "My name is Reuben" to you, then you learn that my name is Reuben, but also that I did not think you knew that my name is Reuben.

That's why it would be weird for me to turn to someone I knew well and introduce myself.

To generalize:

Saying P conveys not just P, but also that my interlocutor didn't know P

So, we can use language to communicate about what our interlocutor does *not* know. A question arises: is there a way to communicate about what our interlocuor *does* know?

For example, can I produce an utterance that communicates that my interlocutor already knew P?

Irony is that method
