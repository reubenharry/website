Mathematical ideas tend to be inscrutable until you look at them the right way, after which point they seem obvious. I think this is why maths lecturers often have a hard time refraining from saying things like: "it trivially follows that". In particular, there are several things that I've found to have made my attempts to learn some basic maths difficult:

- Bad signaling: When learning maths, I often find that textbooks and notes don't signal the high level narrative of what they're doing as much as they should. For example, you'll often find maths textbook that launch into complicated proofs without saying "The reason we're proving this result is that we can then decompose the following problems into...", or "Once we've done this proof, we'll have a tool to...". Instead, you often have to reverse engineer that information.

- Bad design: mathematicians are often less obsessed than programmers with good design, because they're smart enough to be able to steam-roller through difficult ideas with sheer brain power. I, on the other hand, have trouble focusing, hate fiddly computations, and want to be as lazy as possible.

- Unknown prerequisites: often, when something seems particularly difficult to learn, it's because it's relying on some presupposed body of knowledge that I'm just not familiar with.

These notes address none of the above. They're more like a reference sheet of derivations, definitions or explanations I'm making as I go along, for my own reference. I've put them online because it incentivizes me to make them look presentable. Which is not to say that they are even remotely error free.
