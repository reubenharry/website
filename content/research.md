During my PhD, I worked on unifying logical, computational, cognitive and statistical perspectives on meaning in natural language using [Bayesian models of pragmatic reasoning](https://reubencohngordon.com/blog/social-reasoning-in-arcadia/).

In particular, I was interested in scaling these models in computationally tractable ways to handle the complexity of natural language, as well as extending them to handle various kinds of non-literal language and sociolinguistic indexicality.

Two long-term projects which I never ended up publishing:

- [Verbal Irony, Pretense, and the Common Ground](/docs/irony.pdf) <br/> (**unpublished draft**, Cohn-Gordon and Bergen)
- [Metaphor and Linguistic Creativity](/docs/metaphor.pdf) <br/> (**unpublished draft**, experiment section should be disregarded; the baseline model was implemented incorrectly. Cohn-Gordon and Bergen)
