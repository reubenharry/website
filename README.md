# reubenharry.github.io
personal website

The website is built using Hugo, with theme [cocoa](https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/). You can look
up Hugo documentation or the Cocoa-specific documentation for more on how to use it.

It's deployed by Travis CI (travis-ci.org; log in with your GitHub), which runs Hugo every time you
push to the repo and pushes the result to reubenharry.github.io.
